# Deployment Scripts Overview

Welcome to the Deployment Scripts directory of QuantumLink! This directory contains scripts and utilities for deploying QuantumLink onto Pi Network servers or cloud infrastructure. These scripts automate deployment tasks and streamline the integration process. Below is an overview of the available deployment scripts and how to use them:

## 1. setup_quantumlink.sh

### Description:
This shell script automates the installation and configuration of QuantumLink on Pi Network servers or cloud infrastructure. It installs necessary dependencies, configures settings, and sets up QuantumLink for integration.

### Usage:
1. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to execute shell scripts on the target servers or cloud instances.
2. Modify the script variables such as installation paths, configuration options, and server credentials as needed.
3. Run the script on each target server or cloud instance to deploy QuantumLink.

## 2. deploy_quantumlink.py

### Description:
This Python script facilitates the deployment of QuantumLink onto multiple Pi Network servers or cloud instances. It orchestrates the deployment process, manages server configurations, and ensures consistent deployment across the infrastructure.

### Usage:
1. Install Python on the deployment manager machine if not already installed.
2. Modify the script variables such as server addresses, credentials, and deployment options in the configuration file.
3. Run the script on the deployment manager machine to initiate the deployment process.

## 3. update_quantumlink_config.py

### Description:
This Python script updates the configuration of QuantumLink on deployed servers or cloud instances. It allows for dynamic configuration changes without the need for manual intervention on each server.

### Usage:
1. Ensure that Python is installed on the target servers or cloud instances where QuantumLink is deployed.
2. Modify the script variables such as configuration parameters and server addresses as needed.
3. Run the script on each target server or cloud instance to update the QuantumLink configuration.

Feel free to explore, customize, and utilize these deployment scripts to streamline the deployment and integration of QuantumLink into your Pi Network infrastructure.
